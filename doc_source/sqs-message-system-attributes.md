# Amazon SQS Message System Attributes<a name="sqs-message-system-attributes"></a>

Whereas you can use [message attributes](sqs-message-attributes.md) to attach custom metadata to Amazon SQS messages for your applications, you can use *message system attributes* to store metadata for other AWS services, such as AWS X\-Ray\. For more information, see the `MessageSystemAttribute` request parameter of the `[SendMessage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessage.html)` and `[SendMessageBatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessageBatch.html)` API actions, the `AWSTraceHeader` attribute of the `[ReceiveMessage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_ReceiveMessage.html)` API action, and the `[MessageSystemAttributeValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_MessageSystemAttributeValue.html)` data type in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service API Reference*\.

Message system attributes are structured exactly like message attributes, with the following exceptions:
+ Currently, the only supported message system attribute is `AWSTraceHeader`\. Its type must be `String` and its value must be a correctly formatted AWS X\-Ray trace header string\.
+ The size of a message system attribute doesn't count towards the total size of a message\.
