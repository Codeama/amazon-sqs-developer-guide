# Working with Amazon SQS APIs<a name="sqs-working-with-apis"></a>

This section provides information about constructing Amazon SQS endpoints, making Query API requests using the `GET` and `POST` methods, and using batch API actions\. For detailed information about Amazon SQS [API actions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html)—including parameters, errors, examples, and [data types](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html) —see the [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/)\.

To access Amazon SQS using a variety of programming languages, you can also use [AWS SDKs](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk) which contain the following automatic functionality:

+ Cryptographically signing your service requests

+ Retrying requests

+ Handling error responses

For command\-line tool information, see the Amazon SQS sections in the [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sqs/index.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sqs/index.html) and the [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/)\.
