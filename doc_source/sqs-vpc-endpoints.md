# Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Endpoints for Amazon SQS<a name="sqs-vpc-endpoints"></a>

If you use Amazon VPC to host your AWS resources, you can establish a connection between your VPC and Amazon SQS\. You can use this connection to send messages to your Amazon SQS queues without crossing the public internet\.

Amazon VPC lets you launch AWS resources in a custom virtual network\. You can use a VPC to control your network settings, such as the IP address range, subnets, route tables, and network gateways\. For more information about VPCs, see the *[Amazon VPC User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/)*\.

To connect your VPC to Amazon SQS, you must first define an *interface VPC endpoint*, which lets you connect your VPC to other AWS services\. The endpoint provides reliable, scalable connectivity to Amazon SQS without requiring an internet gateway, network address translation \(NAT\) instance, or VPN connection\. For more information, see [Tutorial: Sending a Message to an Amazon SQS Queue from Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](sqs-sending-messages-from-vpc.md) and [Example 5: Deny Access if It Isn't from a VPC Endpoint](sqs-creating-custom-policies-access-policy-examples.md#deny-not-from-vpc) in this guide and [Interface VPC Endpoints \(AWS PrivateLink\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.
