Unlike standard queues, FIFO queues don't introduce duplicate messages\. FIFO queues help you avoid sending duplicates to a queue\. If you retry the `SendMessage` action within the 5\-minute deduplication interval, Amazon SQS doesn't introduce any duplicates into the queue\.

To configure deduplication, you must do one of the following:
+ Enable content\-based deduplication\. This instructs Amazon SQS to use a SHA\-256 hash to generate the message deduplication ID using the body of the messageâ€”but not the attributes of the message\. For more information, see the documentation on the `[CreateQueue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_CreateQueue.html)`, `[GetQueueAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_GetQueueAttributes.html)`, and `[SetQueueAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SetQueueAttributes.html)` actions in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service API Reference*\.
+ Explicitly provide the message deduplication ID \(or view the sequence number\) for the message\. For more information, see the documentation on the `[SendMessage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessage.html)`, `[SendMessageBatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessageBatch.html)`, and `[ReceiveMessage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_ReceiveMessage.html)` actions in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service API Reference*\.
